# Honkai: Star Rail - Character Data Pipeline
This repository contains a data project built around **Honkai: Star Rail** character information.
The objective is to design a complete workflow that retrieves raw game data, organizes it into a structured format, and produces meaningful insights such as character summaries and build evaluations.

# Extraction
[EnkaNetwork API](https://github.com/EnkaNetwork/API-docs) is used to collect data from the player. It fetches player, characters and their builds informations from the Character Showcase using a web API.
